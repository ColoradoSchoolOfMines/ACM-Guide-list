ACM Resource Lists
==================

Resource lists, and processes for Mines ACM.
--------------------------------------------

This repository is meant to be a place where ACM members can compile a list of
guides and other resources that are useful for learning a certain topic. The
topics can range from Computer Science and Software Engineering to life skills
such as how to balance a check book.

Contributing

Feel free to add links to guides that you have found helpful. All members of the
ACM team should have push access to everything except ``master``, which means
you can create a branch and submit a PR for that branch. If you are not on the
ACM team, ask one of the officers to add you.
