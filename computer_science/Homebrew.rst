Overview
--------

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS (formerly Mac OS X). Homebrew allows you
to install programs easily from the command line. For example, to install Visual
Studio Code, all you need to do is: `brew cask install visual-studio-code`. Much
nicer than having to find a download link!
