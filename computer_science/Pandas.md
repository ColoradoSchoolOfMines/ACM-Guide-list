## Overview
Pandas is a python Package for handling data. Pandas is usually used in 
conjunction with other packages like Numpy, Scikit Learn, and MatPlotlib for 
data visualization and data cleaning.

## Installing Pandas

### With pip
    pip install pandas

### Linux

Pandas can be installed with a Linux package manager, but it is not recommended.
 The packages in the linux package managers are often a few versions behind and 
 it is **highly** recommended to use either `pip` or `anaconda` to install.
