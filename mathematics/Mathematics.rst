LaTeX
-----

LaTeX is an typesetting tool designed to work well with mathematics and computer
programming. It's syntax and versatility makes it ideal for both mathematicians,
computer scientists, and more. If you've ever looked at a technical Wikipedia
page, you've seen LaTeX typed equations in action.  However, it can be used for
presentations, reports, etc.
