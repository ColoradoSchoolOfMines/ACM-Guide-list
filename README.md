# ACM Guide list

Guides, procedures, and processes for Mines ACM.

---

This repo is meant to be a place where ACM members can link to guides that are
useful to learn a certain topic. The topics can range from Computer Science and
Software Engineering to life skills such as how to balance a check book.

## Contributing
Feel free to try your hand at writing your own guides. All members of the ACM
team should have push access. If you are not on the ACM team, ask one of the
officers to add you. You will still need to submit a PR to get your changes
approved.

See the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
