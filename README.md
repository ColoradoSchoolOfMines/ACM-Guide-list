# ACM Guide List

Guides, resources, and processes for Mines ACM.

---

This repository is meant to be a place where ACM members can link to or create
guides that are useful for learning a certain topic. The topics can range from
Computer Science and Software Engineering to life skills such as how to balance
a check book.

## Contributing

Feel free to try your hand at writing your own guides, or add links to existing
guides. All members of the ACM team should have push access. If you are not on
the ACM team, ask one of the officers to add you. You will still need to submit
a PR to get your changes approved.

See the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
